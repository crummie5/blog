                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello H4x0rs!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
At this time you surely have heard about the new and dangerous Citrix vulnerability labeled as CVE-2019-19781, consisting in a Directory Traversal plus Remote Command Execution attack vector. During a real security engagement I had to face a peculiar situation related to this and I wanted to share it with you, hope you find it useful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a quick recap, CVE-2019-19781, also known as “Shitrix” takes advantage of how the Citrix Gateway appliance handles templates. You can create a template by making a call to the &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;vpn&#x2F;..&#x2F;vpns&#x2F;portal&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;newbm.pl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; endpoint and inserting some Perl template into an XML file. This one contains the payload, but it is not executed until a request is made to the &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;vpn&#x2F;..&#x2F;vpns&#x2F;portal&#x2F;&amp;lt;xml_name&amp;gt;.xml&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; endpoint, which is the action that triggers the command execution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few exploits available to the public that implements that process so that you only have to specify the target and press enter to get a shell. However none of these worked for me for a good reason that we are going to explore in the following lines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
